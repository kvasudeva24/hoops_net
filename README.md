# hoops_net

This is a working copy of my project for cs222. Full outline of what this project is meant to accomplish: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bhb3uL8EPnJw1MIMBdgnlZfgS2BIqGfXjbIO5QYNvRM/edit?usp=sharing 

I am tasked with making the back end model/neural network

I wanted to track my progress and put it on my github. The full site when up and running will be linked here.
